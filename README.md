India Mineral Distribution & Reserves Dashboard
📌 Project Overview
This Power BI project provides a comprehensive visualization of India’s mineral wealth. It analyzes the geographic distribution, total resources, and reserve volumes of key minerals such as Silver ore, Gold, Limestone, and Rock Phosphate.

The dashboard serves as a strategic tool to identify resource-rich zones and compare mineral diversity across different Indian states.

📊 Key Features
Geospatial Analysis: An interactive Mineral Map to visualize deposit clusters across the Indian subcontinent.

Resource Breakdown: A doughnut chart displaying the Sum of Total Resources by state (e.g., Gujarat leading at 35.75%).

Reserve Comparisons: Bar charts detailing reserves by mineral type and by state, highlighting Rajasthan’s dominance in the sector.

Diversity Metrics: Analysis of the variety of minerals found in each state, identifying regions with the highest mineral complexity.

💡 Key Insights
Rajasthan holds the highest mineral diversity with 31 distinct mineral types and 183M in reserves.

Silver Ore constitutes the largest reserve by volume at 301M.

Gujarat and Goa combined account for over 60% of the total resources analyzed in this dataset.
