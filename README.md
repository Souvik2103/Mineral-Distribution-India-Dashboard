# ⛏️ Mineral Distribution & Resource Analysis Dashboard

![Dashboard Preview](Dashboard.jpg)

## 📖 Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive **Power BI Dashboard** designed to visualize and analyze the distribution of mineral resources across India. The report provides insights into mineral availability by state, total and remaining resource estimations, and major mining companies operating in the sector.

This tool is useful for understanding the geoeconomic landscape of India's mining sector, helping to visualize where key resources (like Bauxite, Iron Ore, Coal, etc.) are concentrated.

## 📊 Key Features & Insights

* **State-wise Mineral Count:** A breakdown of mineral types per state, highlighting **Rajasthan (25)** and **Andhra Pradesh (20)** as leading states in mineral variety.
* **Resource Quantification:**
    * **Total Resources:** Detailed bar charts showing **Odisha (92K)** and **Jharkhand (89K)** as the states with the highest volume of total resources.
    * **Remaining Resources:** Analysis of remaining reserves to assist in future planning and sustainability studies.
* **Corporate Analysis:** A deep dive into company-wise reserves, featuring major industry players like **UltraTech Cement, BCCL, MCL, and Hindustan Zinc Ltd.**
* **Geospatial Visualization:** An interactive map plotting mineral deposits across the Indian subcontinent for location-based analysis.
* **Interactive Slicers:** Users can filter data by specific mineral types (e.g., Bauxite, Calcite, China Clay) to view specific trends.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
* **Microsoft Power BI:** For data modeling, DAX calculations, and visualization.
* **Data Source:** (Mention your source here, e.g., Indian Bureau of Mines, Ministry of Mines, or Dummy Data).
* **Data Transformation:** Power Query was used for cleaning and normalization of state and company data.

## 📂 File Structure
* `Mineral Distribution dashboard.pbix`: The source Power BI file containing the data model and report layout.
* `Dashboard.jpg`: Static preview of the final report.

## 🚀 How to Use
1.  Download the `.pbix` file from this repository.
2.  Open the file using **Microsoft Power BI Desktop**.
3.  Interact with the slicers on the right panel to filter by specific minerals.
4.  Hover over charts to see tooltips with specific reserve numbers.
